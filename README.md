# CORAS The Explorer

A web application presenting the CORAS approach and language, to aid in learning the framework.

## Vision

To make a comprehensive web application that can serve users of the CORAS approach of all levels from beginner to advanced, by providing up-to-date introduction and tutorials, and documentation of the language. The application should also include an interactive CORAS editing tool to allow users to test and work with the language in the browser.

In addition to being a great tool for users, the application code should be easily understandable and maintainable.

## Next step

Create a prototype with a short, basic introduction to the language concepts, and possibly a first prototype of an editing tool.
