				Have you ever asked yourself some of the following questions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Should I worry when using my credit card on the Internet?</li>
				<li>How safe is my Internet bank account?</li>
				<li>How many doctors or healthcare personnel have access to my personal health records?</li>
				<li>Can I be sure that I am the only one reading my e-mail?</li>
				<li>How crucial can a single personal mistake be for my company?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A security risk analysis may provide answers to such questions.<br />
				CORAS is a method for conducting security risk analysis, Which means that CORAS can help you answer such questions. Neat!
			</p>
			<p>
				CORAS is the name of a risk analysis method, a modelling language, and a set of tools. Together we call these <em>The CORAS Approach</em>.
				Through reading the information and going through the tutorials on this page, you will become familiar with the different elements of the CORAS approach, and can use them
				in your business or life as an aid to assess risks and threats, and mitigate them.
